\section{The Tangent and Velocity Problems}

\subsection{The Tangent Problem}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Big Idea of Differential Calculus}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item The big idea of differential calculus is very simple:
  \item We will try to study curves and other complicated, varying
    phenomena by approximating them by the simplest shapes we know:
  \item Lines.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Describing Lines}
  \begin{columns}
  \column{0.65\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  %\item We use a Cartesian coordinate system for everything we do in
  %  calculus.
  %\item Here is a line drawn in the plane.  We want to be able to
  %  describe it.
  \item One way we can try to describe a line is by finding a point
    through which it passes.
  \item However, many different lines go through any given point, so
    the point is not a complete description of the line.
  \item We could describe a line completely by giving two points on
    the line:
    $\displaystyle \frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0} = \frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}$
  \item But it is often better to describe a line in terms of a point
    on it and the slope of the line: $y-y_0 = m(x-x_0)$ where the
    slope $m = \frac{\mbox{rise}}{\mbox{run}}$.

    \item Many phenomena in nature are actually best represented by
      curves.
    \item The basic idea of differential calculus is to use a line to
      approximate a given curve in the ``neighborhood'' of a given
      point.
    \item That point we will call the ``base point'' for the time
      being.
    \item The best linear approximation is called the \emph{tangent}
      to the curve at the base point.

  \frametitle{Is Linear Approximation Possible?}
  You may wonder whether linear approximation is always possible.
  
  The answer is `sometimes': only when zooming in on the base point
  makes the curve look more and more straight.

  \frametitle{Is Linear Approximation Possible?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Linear approximation is possible for a wide range of curves.
  \item Curves which can be linearly approximated are called
    \textbf{differentiable} for a reason we will explore shortly.
  \item Most of the curves we encounter in modern science are
    differentiable.
  \item There are many interesting functions which are not
    differentiable, however, such as fractals.
  \item Calculus doesn't apply to non-differentiable functions.  You
    likely won't study non-differentiable functions in detail unless
    you go to graduate school.

  \item We can make a table giving the slope of the secant line
    as a function of the $x$-value of the second point on the secant:

      \begin{tabular}{|l|l||l|l|}
        \hline
        $x$     & $m$     & $x$     & $m$     \\

	$0$     & $1$     & $2$     & $3$     \\

	$0.999$ & $1.999$ & $1.001$ & $2.001$ \\
	\hline
      \end{tabular}
    \end{quote}
    Note: I have considered secants both above and below the tangent in 
    the table.
    \pause
  \item The above gives us strong reason to suspect that the slope of
    the tangent line is $2$.%
    \pause
  \item How can we be sure?  We must learn more about limits.  That
    will be in section 1.5.

\subsection{Examples and Exercises}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Examples}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the 
    CN Tower, 450 m above the ground.  
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the average velocity of the
      ball for an interval beginning at $t=3$ seconds and lasting 
      (i) 0.5 seconds, (ii) 0.1 second, (iii) 0.05 seconds, (iv) 0.01
      second.  (Use Galileo's law: the distance travelled by a falling
      ball in $t$ seconds is $s(t) = 4.9t^2$ metres, neglecting air
      resistance.)
    \item Estimate the instantaneous velocity when $t=3$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Estimate $\sqrt{99}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Solution to Example 1(a)(i)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)(i)] The interval begins at $t=3$ and ends $0.5$ seconds
    later at $t=3.5$.  The position of the ball at $t=3$ is
    $s(3)=4.9(3)^2 = 44.1$ metres below the observation deck.  The
    position of the ball at $t=3.5$ is $s(3.5)=4.9(3.5)^2=60.0$ metres
    below the observation deck, approximately.

    The distance travelled (the rise on the position vs. time graph)
    is $s(3.5)-s(3)=60.0-44.1=15.9$ metres.  The time taken (the run
    on the position vs. time graph) is $3.5-3=0.5$.  The average
    velocity (the slope on the position vs. time graph) is rise/run
    $= 15.9/0.5=31.8$ meters per second.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Answers to Examples 1(a)(ii,iii,iv)}
  Similar calculations give us the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)(ii)] The average velocity on the interval $t\in [3,3.1]$ is
    \begin{displaymath}
      \frac{s(3.1)-s(3)}{3.1-3}=\frac{47.1-44.1}{0.1} = 30\mbox{m/s}
    \end{displaymath}
  \item[(a)(iii)] The average velocity on the interval $t\in [3,3.05]$ is
    \begin{displaymath}
      \frac{s(3.05)-s(3)}{3.05-3}=\frac{45.58-44.1}{0.05} = 29.64\mbox{m/s}
    \end{displaymath}
  \item[(a)(iv)] The average velocity on the interval $t\in [3,3.01]$ is
    \begin{displaymath}
      \frac{s(3.01)-s(3)}{3.01-3}=\frac{44.39-44.1}{0.01} = 29.45\mbox{m/s}
    \end{displaymath}
  \end{itemize}
  (Note that I had to use more digits of accuracy as the time measurement
  became smaller and more accurate.)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Answers to Example 1(b)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[(b)] From the above data, it seems that the slopes of the
    secant lines (i.e., the average velocities) are declining below
    29.45.  A reasonable guess would be 29.4.  However we don't have
    enough data to be really sure.  We really need to look at time
    intervals before $t=3$, such as the interval $t\in(2.9,3)$, to get
    a good bound on the instantaneous velocity.
  
    However, we will soon learn an easier way of calculating the
    instantaneous velocity, from which it will follow that the
    instantaneous velocity is exactly 29.4 m/s.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Solution to Example 2}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This question is difficult, 
    but shows us that we can already do something
    interesting with what we've learned.
  \item The big idea is that we are going to try to approximate the
    function $y=f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ by a tangent line
    $y=t(x)=m(x-x_0)+y_0$.  We can then easily approximate
    $\sqrt{99} = f(99)$ by $t(99)$.
  \item To describe the tangent line, we need to find a base point and
    a slope.  The base point is easy: we choose a nearby $x$ value for
    which we know the square root.  Let's choose $x_0=100$, $y_0=10$.
  \item For greater accuracy, we could choose a base point closer to
    $x=99$ if we wanted.  Think about how hou would pick a base point
    closer to $x=99$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Solution to Example 2: points on curve}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item All that remains is to find the slope of the tangent line.
  \item The only way we know how to do that now is by finding a set of
    points on the curve sliding in to the base point, finding the
    slopes of the secants, and guessing the slope of the tangent.
  \item It isn't immediately clear how to find a point on the curve.
    However, if we're being clever, we might come up with the idea of
    picking $y$ values instead of picking $x$ values.  For example, if
    we pick $y=10.1$, we get $x=y^2=10.1^2=102$.  That gives us the
    point $(102.01,10.1)$ on the curve.
  \item Picking $y=10.05$, $10.01$, and $10.005$ gives us the points
    $(101.0025,10.05)$ $(100.2001,10.01)$, and $(100.100025)$
    respectively.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Solution to Example 2: slopes of secants}
  We can now find the slopes of the secant lines.  Recall that the
  base point is $(100,10)$.
  \begin{quote}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
      \hline
      $x_1$        & $y_1$    & $y_1-y_0$   & $x_1-x_0$   & $m$       \\
      \hline
      $102.01$     & $10.1$   & $0.1$       & $2.01$      & $0.04975$ \\
      $101.0025$   & $10.05$  & $0.05$      & $1.0025$    & $0.04988$ \\
      $100.2001$   & $10.01$  & $0.01$      & $0.2001$    & $0.04998$ \\
      $100.100025$ & $10.005$ & $0.005$     & $0.100025$  & $0.04999$ \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{quote}
  From the table, we see that the slopes of the secant lines seem to
  be converging to $0.05$; that would be a reasonable guess for the slope
  of the tangent line.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Solution to Example 2: tangent line and answer}
  We can now fill in the blanks and write down the equation of
  the tangent line.  We have $x_0=100$, $y_0=10$, and $m=0.05$
  giving
  \begin{displaymath}
    y=t(x)=m(x-x_0)+y_0 = 0.05(x-100)+10.
  \end{displaymath}
  Using the tangent line to approximate $\sqrt{99}$, we have
  \begin{displaymath}
    \sqrt{99} \approx t(99) = 0.05(99-100)+10 = 9.95.
  \end{displaymath}
  My calculator says that $\sqrt{99}=9.9499$ to four digits of accuracy,
  so we have an excellent approximation.

  \textbf{Note:} there is an easier way to do this.  Also, we don't
  yet have error bounds on our approximation.  We'll learn more about
  those later.
