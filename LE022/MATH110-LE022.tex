\section{The Derivative as a Function}

\subsection{The Derivative as a Function}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A Simple Derivative Calculation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Suppose we need to know the velocity at time $t=1$ 
    of a ball dropped from
    rest at time $t=0$.  
  \pause
  \item According to Galileo, the position of the ball
    is given by $s(t)=4.9t^2$ metres after $t$ seconds.
  \pause
  \item Our definition of velocity then tells us that
    \begin{displaymath}
      v(1) = s'(1) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{s(1+h)-s(1)}{h}
    \end{displaymath}
  \pause
  \item Doing the calculation, we find
    \begin{align*}
      s(1) &= 4.9 \\
      s(1+h) &= 4.9(1+h)^2 = 4.9(1+2h+h^2) \\
             &= 4.9 + 9.8h + 4.9h^2 
    \end{align*}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A Simple Derivative Calculation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Subtracting the previous two,
    \begin{align*}
      s(1+h)-s(1) &= 4.9 + 9.8h + 4.9h^2 - 4.9  \\
                  &= 9.8 h + 4.9h^2 \\
      s'(1) &= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{9.8h + 4.9h^2}{h} \\
            &= \lim_{h\to 0} 9.8 + 4.9 h \\
	    &= 9.8
    \end{align*}
  \pause
  \item So the velocity of the ball at $t=1$ seconds is $9.8$ metres per second
    (downward).
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Another Simple Derivative Calculation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Now suppose I find that I need to calculcate the velocity of the
    ball at $t=2$ seconds.
  \pause
  \item I could repeat the above calculation with base time $2$ instead
    of base time $1$.
  \pause
  \item However, I may need to repeat the calculation at $t=3,4$ etc.
    Instead of re-doing similar looking calculations over and over, I could
    just leave a variable $a$ in place of the number $1$ in the above
    calculation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Same Derivative Calculation with Variable Base Time}
  Calculating the derivative $s'(a)$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    s(a) &= 4.9 a^2 \\
    s(a+h) &= 4.9(a+h)^2=4.9a^2+9.8ah+4.9h^2 \\
    s(a+h)-s(a) &= 9.8ah + 4.9h^2 \\
    v(a) = s'(a) &= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{9.8ah+4.9h^2}{h}
    = \lim_{h\to 0} 9.8 a + 4.9 h \\
    &= 9.8a
  \end{align*}
  \pause %
  I have saved some repetitive work by using $a$ as a variable, but now
  my derivative is a \textbf{function of $a$}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Derivative as a Function}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The derivative can be regarded as a function of the base
    number $a$, and we can write $s'(a)$.
  \pause
  \item However, since $a$ lies on the $t$ axis, it is customary
    in this situation to use $t$ as the variable rather than $a$.
  \pause
  \item But that is just a matter of tradition; $s'(a)$ and $s'(t)$ are
    the same function.
  \pause
  \item So we can define the derivative as a function of $t$ by
    the formula
    \begin{displaymath}
      s'(t) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{s(t+h)-s(t)}{h}
    \end{displaymath}
  \pause
  \item That is why I prefer the $\ds\lim_{h\to 0}$ version of the definition
    of derivative over the $\ds\lim_{t\to a}$ version.  (Try it the other way
    to see what happens!)
  \end{itemize}

  \item Since the derivative can be regarded as a function of $t$ (or of
    $x$, as appropriate), we can graph it just as we graph any function.

  \uncover<2->{
  \item For example, consider the graph of some function $f(x)$.
  }%
  \uncover<3->{
  \item I have graphed the derivative $f'(x)$ below that $f(x)$; the
    scale and position of the $x$-axis is the same for both graphs.
    I could have graphed them both on one set of axes, but for now it
    is less confusing to separate the graphs.

  \item For now, note that 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item when $f$ is increasing, $f'$ is positive; 
    \item when $f$ is decreasing, $f'$ is negative; and 
    \item when $f$ is `stationary', $f'$ is $0$.
    \end{enumerate}
  }%

  \item Using that relationship, given two graphs, one of a function
    $f$ and the other of its derivative $f'$, it should be possible to
    determine which is which.

\subsection{Other Notations}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Other Notations}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There were initially two streams in the development of calculus, one
    due to Newton and the other due to Leibniz.
  \pause
  \item We have been using notation similar to Newton's for the derivative,
    $f'$.
  \pause
  \item The corresponding Leibniz notation for the derivative is
    $\ds \frac{df}{dx}$ or sometimes $\ds \frac{dy}{dx}$ or $\ds\frac{d}{dx} f$.
  \pause
  \item Both notation systems have their advantages and disadvantages.
    Newton's is clean and simple, but can be difficult to use in a `change
    of variable situation' but under-emphasizes the role of $x$.  
  \pause
  \item Leibniz's notation behaves nicely under changes of variable 
    and emphasizes the relationship between $\ds\frac{df}{dx}$ and
    $\ds\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}$, but may be misunderstood as an
    ordinary fraction.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{How a Function Can Fail to be Differentiable}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{How a Function Can Fail to be Differentiable}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I have used the phrase `if $f'(a)$ exists' in some of the definitions
    in a previous lecture.
  \pause
  \item The derivative may fail to exist at a point $a$ even if the function
    is defined and continuous at $a$.  In other words, the domain of $f'(x)$
    as a function may be smaller than the domain of $f(x)$.
  \pause
  \item Recall that the derivative is a limit, so derivatives can fail to
    exist in the same ways limits can fail to exist:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \pause
    \item One-sided limits exist but differ.
    \pause
    \item A one-sided limit is infinite.
    \pause
    \item A one-sided limit doesn't exist but isn't infinite (oscillatory
      behaviour).
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \column{0.65\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}

  \item If the one-sided derivatives exist but differ at $a$, we say
    that the function has an \textbf{angle point} at $a$.
  }%
  \uncover<3->{
  \item If a one-sided derivative is infinite at $a$, there are
    several possibilities.
  }%
  \uncover<7->{
  \item If a one-sided derivative doesn't exist, likely the function
    oscillates infinitely fast in the neighbourhood of $a$.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Continuity and Differentiability}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If a function is not continuous at $a$, I can prove that the function
    is not differentiable at $a$.  The proof is in the textbook for those
    who are interested.
  \pause
  \item It follows that if a function is differentiable at $a$, it must be
    continuous at $a$.
  \pause
  \item The converse is \textbf{not true}.  A function may be continuous
    at $a$ yet not be differentiable at $a$.  We have seen several examples
    (angle point, cusp, and vertical tangent) already.
  \pause
  \item It follows that
    the domain of $f'$ can be smaller than the domain of $f$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Higher Derivatives}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Higher Derivatives}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Suppose we have a function $f$ of a variable $x$.  
    We can find the derivative $f'$ as another function of the variable $x$,
    perhaps on some smaller domain.
  \pause
  \item Since $f'$ is a function of $x$, we can differentiate it too,
    getting a derivative $(f')'$.  That function is usually denoted by
    $f''$ and is called the second derivative of $f$.
  \pause
  \item In Leibniz notation we write $\ds \frac{d}{dx} \frac{d}{dx} f$
    or $\ds \frac{d}{dx} \frac{df}{dx}$ which can be abbreviated to
    $\ds \frac{d^2}{dx^2} f$ or $\ds \frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$ respectively.
  \pause
  \item In a similar way, we can find third and higher derivatives of
    a function.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Interpretation of Higher Derivatives}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $s(t)$ represents the position of a particle on a line at
    time $t$, we know the interpretation of $s'(t)$ as the velocity of 
    the particle.
  \pause
  \item There is also an interpretation of $s''(t)$: it is the 
    \textbf{(instantaneous) acceleration} of the particle at time $t$.
  \pause
  \item Newton's law in physics shows how useful second derivatives can
    be.  Most of the laws of mechanics can be phrased in terms of second
    derivatives.
    We will also find other applications for second derivatives in
    graphing and optimization.
  \pause
  \item Third and higher derivatives will not be particularly useful to
    us, but they do appear in the study of elasticity and fluid flow.
  \pause
  \item Another famous use of third derivatives was by Richard Nixon,
    who once stated, ``The rate of increase of inflation is now decreasing''.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
