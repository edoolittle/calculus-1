\section{Optimization Problems}

\subsection{Steps in Solving Optimization Problems}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Steps in Solving Optimization Problems}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Optimization problems are word problems in which your goal is
    to maximize or minimize some quantity: time, cost, profit, etc.
  \item Steps required to solve such problems typically include:
    \begin{enumerate}[<+->]
    \item \textbf{Understand the problem.}  You will need to read carefully and
      understand the statement of the problem before you can solve it.  You
      may have to return to this step repeatedly as you move through the other
      steps.
    \item \textbf{Draw a diagram.}  Essential for geometry-related problems.
    \item \textbf{Introduce notation.}  Sometimes it is given, usually you
      need to introduce it yourself.
    \item \textbf{Find a formula for $Q$, the quantity to be maximized.}
    \item \textbf{Find formulas for constraints.}  Use them to reduce $Q$
      to a function of one variable.
    \item \textbf{Use the methods of 3.1, 3.3, 3.4 to find the 
      \textit{absolute} maximum or minimum of $Q$.}  Check end behaviour!
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Skills Required}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item In nearly every problem, four major steps are required:
    \begin{enumerate}[<+->]
    \item Analysis: Go from words to formulas for objective $Q$ 
      and constraint(s) $C$.
    \item Algebra: Eliminate dependent variables in $Q$ by solving $C$.
    \item Calculus: Find the absolute maximum or minimum value of $Q$.
    \item Interpretation: Re-read the question and answer it in words.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item The skills required in each case are different:
    \begin{enumerate}[<+->]
    \item Analysis: understanding, 
       visualization, and conversion of words to symbols.
    \item Algebra: algebraic manipulations.
    \item Calculus: essentially the same skills as for curve sketching.
    \item Interpretation: understanding and conversion of symbols to words.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Advice}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Optimization problems are some of the most useful applications
    of calculus we will study.
  \item Optimization problems are difficult because they test a wide 
    spectrum of skills and abilities.
  \item With optimization problems, as with all word problems,
    lots of practice is necessary to build skill.
  \item The problems we will look at divide into categories (dealing with
    numbers, geometry with rectangles, geometry with circles and rectangles,
    three dimensional geometry with boxes, trigonometry, etc.)
  \item Once you have done a few problems in each category, you will be able
    to solve others in that category more quickly.
  \item Start with easier problems to build skill and then 
    work through as many of the harder problems as you can.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Examples from Algebra}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Sum is Constraint, Product is Objective}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Find two numbers, the sum of which is 23 and the product of which
    is maximum.
  \item We want two numbers, so let's call them $x$ and $y$.
  \item The sum of the two numbers is 23, so $x+y=23$.  That is the 
    constraint in the problem.
  \item The product should be a maximum, so our objective is to maximize
    $Q=xy$.
  \item We use the constraint to eliminate one of the variables, e.g.,
    $y=23-x$ so we can write $Q(x)=xy=x(23-x)$.
  \item To maximize $Q$, we consider $Q'(x)=23-2x$.  The max will occur
    where $Q'(x)=0$, or where $Q'(x)$ doesn't exist (but it always
    exists), or at an endpoint
    of the domain (there is no endpoint).  Solving $Q'(x)=0$ we have
    $23-2x=0$ or $x=23/2$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Sum is Constraint, Product is Objective, ctd.}
  \begin{columns}
  \column{0.65\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item We have found $Q(x)=xy=x(23-x)$ has a critical point at $x=23/2$.
  \item We need to check that $Q(x)$ has a \textbf{maximum} at $x=23/2$.
  \item $Q'(x)>0$ for $x<23/2$,
    and $Q'(x)<0$ for $x>23/2$, so $Q(x)$ increases to $x=23/2$ 
    then decreases.
  \item By the first derivative test, $Q$ has an absolute maximum at
    $x=23/2$.
  \item Now we can answer the problem: The two numbers which add to 
    $23$ and have the largest possible product are $x=23/2$ and $y=23-x
    =23/2$.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Sum is Objective, Product is Constraint}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Find two positive numbers, the product of which is 100 and the
    sum of which is minimum.
  \item Again, let our two numbers be $x$ and $y$.
  \item We have the constraint $xy=100$.
  \item We have the objective to minimize $Q=x+y$.
  \item We also have the constraint that $x$ and $y$ must be positive;
    in symbols, $x>0$ and $y>0$.
  \item Eliminating the variable $y=100/x$, we reduce the problem to
    minimizing $Q(x)=x+y=x+100/x$, $x>0$.  Note that the domain of $Q$ 
    is not the whole real line, only the half line $(0,\infty)$.
  \item The derivative is $Q'(x)=1-100/x^2$, with critical points
    where $Q'(x)=0$, $1-100/x^2=0$, $x=\pm 10$.
  \item We throw away $x=-10$ because it is outside of the domain of $Q$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Sum is Objective, Product is Constraint, ctd.}
  \begin{columns}
  \column{0.65\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Once again, we need to check that we have an absolute minimum
    at $x=10$.
  \item We have $Q'(x)=1-100/x^2 <0$ for $x<10$, and $Q'(x)>0$ for $x>10$.
  \item So $Q(x)$ decreases to $x=10$ and then increases.
  \item By the First Derivative Test, $Q$ has an absolute minimum
    at $x=10$.
  \item The answer to the question is: the two numbers, the product of which 
    is 100 and the sum of which is a minimum, are $x=10$ and $y=100/x=10$.

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Find a rectangle with perimeter 100 m for which the area is 
    a maximum.
  \item To understand this problem better, we should draw a picture.
  \item We introduce labels for quantities.
  \item We use the geometry of the diagram to label the other sides.
  \item Geometry tells us that the area is
    $A=xy$ and the perimeter is $P=x+y+x+y=2x+2y$.
  \item Our constraint is $P=100$, i.e., $x+y=50$.
  \item Our objective is to maximize $A=xy$.

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Find the point on the line $y=4x+7$ that is closest to the origin.
  \item Again, we draw a diagram, including both the line and the origin.
  \item We introduce a variable $x$ to describe a point on the line.  Then
    the coordinates of the point on the line are $(x,4x+7)$.
  \item We try to imagine how we might find the point that is closest to
    the origin as $x$ moves.  We need a formula for the length of the
    line segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(x,4x+7)$.

  \item Recall that the distance between the two points $(0,0)$ and
    $(x,4x+7)$ is $d(x)=\sqrt{x^2+(4x+7)^2}$ by the Pythagorean theorem.
  \item The usual trick in these problems is to minimize the function 
    $D(x)=(d(x))^2$.  Then we don't have to worry about square roots.
  \item We have $D(x)=x^2+(4x+7)^2=17x^2+56x+49$.
  \item $D'(x)=34x+56$.
  \item $D'(x)=0$ implies $x=-56/34=-28/17$.
  \item The first derivative test tells us there's an absolute min
    at $x=-28/17$.
  \item The point on the line that is closest
    to the origin is $(x,y)=(-28/17,4(-28/17)+7)$.

\subsection{Examples from Business and Economics}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Optimizing Revenue}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item The demand function $p(x)$ is the price per unit that a company 
    can charge if it wants to sell $x$ units.
  \item The revenue function at sales level $x$ is $R(x)=x\cdot p(x)$.
  \item A baseball team plays in a stadium that holds $55,000$ spectators.
    With ticket prices at \$10, the average attendance had been $27,000$.
    When ticket prices were lowered to \$8, the average attendance rose
    to $33,000$.
    \begin{enumerate}[<+->]
    \item Find the demand function, assuming that it is linear.
    \item How should ticket prices be set to maximize revenue?
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Optimizing Profit}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Profit is revenue minus cost at sales level $x$, i.e.,
    $P(x)=x\cdot p(x) - C(x)$.
  \item A manufacturer has been selling $1000$ television sets per
    week at \$450 each.  A market survey indicates that for each \$10
    rebate offered to the buyer, the number of sets sold will increase
    by $100$ per week.
    \begin{enumerate}[<+->]
    \item Find the demand function.
    \item How large a rebate should the company offer to maximize its
      revenue?
    \item If its weekly cost function is $C(x)=68,000+150x$, how should
      the manufacturer set the size of the rebate in order to maximize
      its profit?
