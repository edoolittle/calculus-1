\item %(Based on A.1--8) Rewrite the expression without using |.|
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\ds |8|-|-11| = 8 - 11 = -3$
  \item $\ds |\pi-4| = -(\pi -4)$ because $\pi<4$ so $\pi-4$ is
    negative.  You can simplify the answer: $-(\pi-4) = 4-\pi$.
  \item $\ds \big| \; |-3|-|-5| \; \big| = \left| 3-5 \right| = |-2| = 2$.
  \item $\ds x\ge 2 \implies x-2\ge 0 \implies 2-x\le 0 \implies |2-x| =
    -(2-x)$.  You can simplify the answer: $\ds -(2-x) = x-2$.

  \item $3x-1<2-x \implies 4x < 3 \implies x < \frac{3}{4}$.  See
    Figure~\ref{fig:3x-1LT2-x}.  (Alternatively you could have move
    the $x$'s to the RHS: $\ds 3x-1<2-x \implies -3 < -4x$, and at
    this point you must remember to switch the direction of the
    inequality sign when you divide through by $-4$.  It is best to
    avoid altogether the possibility of making an error by initially
    moving the $x$'s to whichever side makes the coefficient positive,
    as in the first method.)

  \item % $\ds -2\le 3-2x\le 6$
    This is really two inequalities.  In general, we solve two
    inequalities separately, but in this case we can solve them
    simultaneously.  Adding $-3$ everywhere we have
    \begin{equation*}
      -5 \le -2x \le 3
    \end{equation*}
    Dividing through by $-2$ and \textit{reversing the sign of the
      inequalities} we have
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{5}{2} \ge x \ge -\frac{3}{2}
    \end{equation*}
    which I prefer to write using the $\le$ symbol:
    \begin{equation*}
      -\frac{3}{2} \le x \le \frac{5}{2}
    \end{equation*}

\item % (Based on A.43--44) Solve the equation for $x$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\ds |4x|=1$ means ``$\ds 4x=-1$ or $\ds 4x=1$''.  In the
    first case, we have $x=-\frac{1}{4}$.  In the second case, we have
    $x=\frac{1}{4}$.  Altogether, the solution set is
    $\{-\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}\}$.  You should check that each number
    in the set really is a solution to the given equation.
  \item $|2x-1|=4$ means $2x-1=-4$ or $2x-1=4$.  In the first case, we
    have $2x=-3$, $x=-\frac{3}{2}$.  In the second case, we have
    $2x=5$, $x=\frac{5}{2}$.  Altogether the solution set is
    $\{-\frac{3}{2},\frac{5}{2}\}$.  You should check that each number
    in the solution set really is a solution to the given equation.

\item % (Based on A.9--12) Rewrite the expression without using the absolute
  % value symbol.
  We could rewrite the absolute value expressions using the cases
  construction discussed in the lectures but there is a tidier way:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\ds |1-2x| = \sqrt{(1-2x)^2}$
  \item $\ds |x^2-1| = \sqrt{(x^2-1)^2}$
  \end{enumerate}
\item % (Based on A.23--38) Solve the inequality in terms of intervals and
  % illustrate the solution set on the real number line.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item % $\ds 4x-5 < 3x-2 < 5x+2$
    Since there are $x$'s in multiple locations in the given
    inequality $4x-5 < 3x-2 < 5x+2$, rather than just one $x$, we
    can't simultaneously solve both inequalities, so we must work on
    them one at a time.  Solving the first inequality,
    \begin{equation*}
      4x-5 < 3x-2 \implies x < 3
    \end{equation*}
    Solving the second inequality,
    \begin{equation*}
      3x-2 < 5x+2 \implies -4<2x \implies -2<x
    \end{equation*}
    (note how I avoided having to divide through by a negative number
    by carefully chosing which side of the inequality to put my
    $x$'s).  Recombining the results, we have the solution $-2<x<3$.

    which $(x+1)(3x-4)\ge 0$ are $x<-1$, $x=-1$, $x=\frac{3}{4}$, or
    $\frac{3}{4}<x$.  We can combine those possibilities into a two
    inequalities describing the solution set: ``$x\le-1$ or
    $\frac{3}{4}\le x$''.  See Figure~\ref{fig:3x2-x-4GE0}.

    First, we move everything to the LHS leaving just $0$ in the RHS:
    \begin{equation*}
      x^3-5x^2+6x < 0
    \end{equation*}
    Next, we attempt to factor the cubic.  There is a common factor of
    $x$ in every term so we take that out:
    \begin{equation*}
      x(x^2-5x+6) < 0

    Now we factor the quadratic:
    \begin{equation*}
      x(x-2)(x-3) < 0

  \item % $-1<1/x\le 3$
    This problem is rather tricky.  The temptation is to multiply by
    $x$, but remember that if
    $x$ is negative, we must reverse the direction of the inequality
    signs.  The problem is that we don't know anything about
    $x$; it could be positive \textit{or} negative.

    One way out of this is to make a series of assumptions that cover
    all the cases.  The assumptions provide a context within which we
    can make progress.  We are going to look at the cases
    $x<0$, $x=0$, and $x>0$ which cover all the possibilities for
    $x$.  We can quickly dispense with the case $x=0$ because
    $1/x$ is not defined for $x=0$.

    Next let us assume that $x<0$.  Then $1/x\le 3$ is automatically
    satisfied because $1/x < 0 < 3$.  To solve $-1<1/x$ we multiply
    both sides by the negative number $x$ \textit{and reverse the sign
      of the inequality} to obtain $-x>1$.  We multiply both sides by
    $-1$ and reverse the inequality sign a second time to obtain
    $x<-1$.

    Conversely, if $x<-1$ then $x<0$ for sure, so $1/x<0<3$, so
    $1/x\le 3$ is satisfied; and we obtain $-1<1/x$ by dividing $x<-1$
    through by $-x$ (which is a positive number).

    Finally let us assume that $0<x$.  Then $-1<1/x$ is automatically
    satisfied because $-1<0<1/x$, and we just have to ensure
    $1/x\le 3$.  Because $x>0$ we can apply the reciprocal rule, and
    so we have $\frac{1}{3}\le x$.

    Conversely, if $\frac{1}{3}\le x$, then $0<x$ so we can apply the
    reciprocal rule to obtain $1/x\le 3$ and we also have $-1<1/x$
    because $-1<0<1/x$, so the inequality $-1<1/x\le 3$ is satisfied.

    In summary, the inequality $-1<1/x\le 3$ is satisfied when $x<-1$
    or when $\frac{1}{3}\le x$.  See Figure~\ref{fig:-1LT1oxLE3}.

    the course.
  \end{enumerate}
\item % (Based on A.39--42) As dry air moves upward, it expands and in so
  % doing cools at a rate of about $1^{\circ}$C for each 100 m rise, up to
  % about 12000 m.  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item % If the ground temperature is $20^{\circ}$C, write a formula for the
    % temperature at height $h$.
    The temperature $T$ in degrees Celsius at height $h$ in meters is given by
    \begin{equation*}
      \mbox{$\ds T = 20 - \frac{1}{100}h$, $0\le h \le 12000$}
    \end{equation*}
    That says we start with a temperature of 20, then
    \textit{decrease} ($-$) at a \textit{rate of 1 degree per 100}
    ($\frac{1}{100}$) meters ($h$).  We also note that the formula is
    only applicable above the ground ($h\ge 0$) and below a height of
    about 12000 meters ($h\le 12000$).
  \item % What range of temperature can be expected if a plane takes
        % off and reaches standard cruising altitude of 11 000 m?  XX
    We know that $0\le h \le 11000$ in this part of the problem, and
    we want to find an inequality for $T$.  We modify the inequality
    for $h$ until the expression in the middle looks more like $T$.
    First we multiply throughout by $-\frac{1}{100}$:
    \begin{equation*}
      0 \le h \le 11000 \implies 0 \ge -\frac{1}{100} h \ge -110
    \end{equation*}
    Note that we have reversed the sign of the inequalities because
    $-\frac{1}{100}$ is negative.  Now we add 20 throughout:
    \begin{equation*}
      -110 \le -\frac{1}{100} h \le 0 
      \implies -90 \le 20 - \frac{1}{100} h \le 20
    \end{equation*}
    So the range of temperatures we can expect on such a flight is 
    \begin{equation*}
      -90 \le T \le 20
    \end{equation*}
  \end{enumerate}
\item % (Based on A.45--46) Solve the equation for $x$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item % $\ds \frac{|2x+1|}{|x-1|}=3$
    There are two sets of absolute value symbols in the problem.  We
    can reduce the number of absolute value symbols as follows.  We
    have
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{|2x+1|}{|x-1|} = 3
      \implies \left| \frac{2x+1}{x-1} \right| = 3
      \implies \mbox{$\ds \frac{2x+1}{x-1} = -3$ 
        or $\ds \frac{2x+1}{x-1} = 3$}
    \end{equation*}
    In the first case we have
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{2x+1}{x-1} = -3 \implies 2x+1 = -3(x-1)
      \implies 2x+1 = -3x + 3 \implies 5x = 2 \implies x=\frac{2}{5}
    \end{equation*}
    In the second case we have
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{2x+1}{x-1} = 3 \implies 2x+1 = 3(x-1) 
      \implies 2x+1 = 3x-3 \implies 4 = x
    \end{equation*}
    So our solution set is $\{\frac{2}{5},4\}$.  You should check that
    both of those numbers satisfy the original problem.
  \item % $\ds \vphantom{\frac{|x|}{|x|}} |x+4| = |3x-2|$
    Solving this problem benefits from some creative thinking.  One
    way to do it might be to break it up into four cases, e.g.,
    $x+4<0$ and $3x-2<0$ would be one case.  Another way would be to
    break the line up into five pieces ($x<-4$, $x=-4$,
    $-4<x<\frac{2}{3}$, $x=\frac{2}{3}$, $\frac{2}{3}<x$) like we did
    when solving inequalities with quadratics.  However, in this case
    I recommend dividing both sides of the equation by $|x+4|$.  In
    order to do so, we must first check that $x=-4$ is not a solution
    to the equation (it is not) so we know that $|x+4|\ne 0$ and we
    can divide through by $|x+4|$:
    \begin{equation*}
      1 = \frac{|3x-2|}{|x+4|} 
      \implies 1 = \left| \frac{3x-2}{x+4} \right|
    \end{equation*}
    where we have used the absolute value rule
    $|a|/|b|=|a/b|$ as in the previous problem.  Now there is only one
    absolute value sign in the expression and we can use the usual
    method for solving absolute value equalities.  We have
    \begin{equation*}
      \left| \frac{3x-2}{x+4} \right| = 1
      \Longleftrightarrow 
      \mbox{$\ds \frac{3x-2}{x+4} = -1$ or $\ds \frac{3x-2}{x+4} = 1$}
    \end{equation*}
    In the first case we have 
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{3x-2}{x+4} = -1 \implies 3x-2 = -(x+4) \implies
      3x-2 = -x-4 \implies 4x = -2 \implies x = -\frac{1}{2}
    \end{equation*}
    In the second case we have
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{3x-2}{x+4} = 1 \implies 3x-2 = x+4 \implies 2x = 6
      \implies x=3
    \end{equation*}
    So the solution set is $\{-\frac{1}{2},3\}$.  You should check
    that both of those numbers actually are solutions to the equation.
  \end{enumerate}
\item % (Based on A.55--56)
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item % $\ds 3\le |2x| \le 5$
    The most straightforward way to see this is to consider the cases
    $2x< 0$, $2x=0$, and $2x>0$ separately.  The case
    $2x=0$ is obviously eliminated because it implies
    $x=0$ which clearly does not satisfy the inequality.

    In the first case, $2x<0$ implies that
    $|2x|=-2x$ by the definition of absolute value so the inequality
    becomes
    \begin{equation*}
      3\le -2x \le 5 \implies -\frac{3}{2} \ge x \ge -\frac{5}{2}
      \implies -\frac{5}{2} \le x \le -\frac{3}{2}
    \end{equation*}
    where I have just re-written the last inequality using my
    preference of $\le$ over
    $\ge$.  You should check that conversely, $-\frac{5}{2} \le x \le
    -\frac{3}{2}$ implies that $3\le |2x| \le 5$.

    In the remaining case, $2x> 0$ implies that
    $|2x|=2x$ so the inequality becomes
    \begin{equation*}
      3\le 2x \le 5 \implies \frac{3}{2} \le x \le \frac{5}{2} 
    \end{equation*}
    You should check that conversely, $\frac{3}{2} \le x \le
    \frac{5}{2}$ implies that $3\le |2x| \le 5$.
    
    In summary, the solution set is $x$ either in the interval
    $[-\frac{5}{2},-\frac{3}{2}]$ or in the interval
    $[\frac{3}{2},\frac{5}{2}]$.  In other words, the solution set is
    the union
    $[-\frac{5}{2},-\frac{3}{2}]\cup [\frac{3}{2},\frac{5}{2}]$.  See
    Figure~\ref{fig:3LEabs2xLE5}.

  \item % $\ds 0<|x-4|<1$
    This problem is similar to the previous, but the outcome is
    slightly different.  We again consider two separate cases, $x-4\ge
    0$ and $x-4<0$.  In the first case we have
    \begin{equation*}
      0 < |x-4| < 1 \implies 0 < x-4 < 1 \implies 4<x<5
    \end{equation*}
    In the second case we have $|x-4| = -(x-4)$ and so
    \begin{equation*}
      0 < |x-4| < 1 \implies 0 < -(x-4) < 1 \implies 0>x-4>-1 
      \implies 4>x>3 \implies 3<x<4
    \end{equation*}
    Altogether we have $x$ must satisfy $3<x<4$ or $4<x<5$.  Note that
    $x$ cannot equal 4 in either case.  See Figure~\ref{fig:0LTabsx-4LT1}.

      \caption{Graph of the solution set of $0\le |x-4| \le 1$}
      \label{fig:0LTabsx-4LT1}

    The solution set is the interval $(3,5)$ with the point $4$
    removed from it; such a solution set is known as a
    \textit{punctured interval}.
  \end{enumerate}
\item % (Based on A.57--70)
  % Solve for $x$, assuming that $b$ and $c$ are positive and $a$ is negative.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item % $ax+b<c$
    It doesn't matter whether $b$ is positive or negative, we can
    subtract $b$ from both sides of the inequality in either case
    without changing the direction of the inequality, so we have  
    \begin{equation*}
      ax+b < c \implies ax < c-b
    \end{equation*}
    Now, because we know that $a$ is negative, we can divide both
    sides of the inequality by $a$ provided we switch the direction of
    the inequality sign:
    \begin{equation*}
      ax < c-b \implies x > \frac{c-b}{a}
    \end{equation*}
    which is the solution to the original inequality.
  \item % $c(ax+b)\le b$
    We solve this problem in a similar manner to the previous:
    \begin{equation*}
      c(ax+b) \le b \implies ax+b \le \frac{b}{c}
      \implies ax \le \frac{b}{c} - b
      \implies x \ge \frac{1}{a} \left(\frac{b}{c} - b\right)
      \implies x \ge \frac{b}{ac} - \frac{b}{a}
    \end{equation*}
    where the last simplification was optional.  You could also add
    fractions if you wanted.
  \end{enumerate}
\item % (Based on Algebra.109--116) State whether or not the equation is true
  % for all values of the variable $x$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item % $\ds\vphantom{\frac{x}{x+y}}\sqrt{x^2+9}=|x|+3$
    Just try some numbers for $x$ with the assistance of your
    calculator.  If you're lucky or pick your numbers carefully, you
    don't even need a calculator.  Let's try $x=4$.  Then the LHS is
    \begin{equation*}
      \sqrt{x^2+9} = \sqrt{4^2+9} = \sqrt{16+9} = \sqrt{25} = 5
    \end{equation*}
    while the RHS is
    \begin{equation*}
      |4|+3 = 4+3 = 7
    \end{equation*}
    The LHS and the RHS disagree in this case, so the equation is
    certainly not true for all values of $x$.  (By the way, this once
    again shows that $\sqrt{x^2+9} \ne \sqrt{x^2} + \sqrt{9}$.)
  \item % $\ds \frac{a}{a+x} = \frac{1}{1+x}$
    If $a=1$, the equation certainly is true for all values of
    $x$, because in that case the LHS and the RHS are exactly the
    same.  If $a$ is any other number, i.e., $a\ne
    1$ and hence $a-1\ne 0$, then we have
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{a}{a+x} = \frac{1}{1+x}
      \implies a(1+x) = 1(a+x) \implies a + ax = a + x
      \implies (a-1)x = 0 
      \implies x = 0
    \end{equation*}
    where we are allowed to divide by $a-1$ because we're assuming
    $a\ne 1$.  So if $a\ne 1$, the original equation is true only if
    $x=0$, which means it's not true for all values of $x$.
