  The first limit statement means that $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close
  to $3$ by taking $x$ close to (but less than) $2$.  The second
  limit statement means that $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close to
  $5$ by taking $x$ close to (but greater than) $2$.  It is not
  possible for $\ds \lim_{x\to 2} f(x)$ to exist, because the two
  one-sided limits at $2$ are not equal.
\item %2
  The limit statement means that $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large
  negative by taking $x$ close to (but not equal to) $-1$.
\item\label{prob:cases} %3
  See Figure~\ref{fig:cases} for the graph.  We see from the graph
  that almost everywhere the left hand limit is equal to the right
  hand limit, except at $x=-2$.  So the only value of $a$ for which
  $\ds \lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ does not exist is $a=-2$.

\item %4 
  The following graph is perhaps the simplest answer to the question.
  Many others are possible.
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ps01q3.eps}
  \end{center}
  The important features of the graph are the four points drawn with open
  or solid dots at $(0,1)$, $(0,-1)$, $(2,0)$, and $(2,1)$, and the portions
  of the curves coming out of those points.  The exact shapes of the curves
  are not important, so the following graph is also a correct answer
  to the question:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ps01q3b.eps}
  \end{center}
  However the following graph is not a correct answer to the question
  because most of the curves don't approach the correct points so the
  limits don't satisfy the conditions of the problem:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item %7a
    The answer is 
    $\ds \lim_{x\to -3^-} \frac{x+2}{x+3} =+\infty$.
    To obtain the answer, you can draw the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:5a},
    or you can argue as follows.
    \begin{figure}
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{ps01q5a.eps}
      \end{center}
      \caption{Graph of $y=(x+2)/(x+3)$}
      \label{fig:5a}
    \end{figure}
    Since $x\to -3^-$ we can assume that $x$ is close to $-3$,
    so the numerator $x+2$ is close to $-1$, a negative number.  Furthermore,
    we can assume that $x$ is slightly less than $-3$, so $x+3$ is a small
    negative number.  Dividing $-1$ by a small negative number gives a
    large positive number, so $\ds \lim_{x\to -3^-} \frac{x+2}{x+3} =+\infty$.
  \item %7b
    You can obtain the answer
    $\ds \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x-1}{x^2(x+2)} = -\infty$
    from the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:5b}, or you can argue as follows.
    As $x\to 0$, we can assume $x$ is close to $0$, so we 
    have $x-1$ close to $-1$, $x+2$ close to $2$, so
    $\ds \frac{x-1}{x+2}$ is close to $-1/2$, a negative number.
    % EJD: this graph is wrong near $x=-2$!

    Now let's look at the one-sided limits separately.  As $x\to 0^-$ we have
    $x^2$ a very small positive number, so 
    $\ds \lim_{x\to 0^-} \frac{x-1}{x^2(x+2)} = -\infty$.  Similarly, as
    $x\to 0^+$ we have $x^2$ again a very small positive number, so
    $\ds \lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{x-1}{x^2(x+2)} = -\infty$.  Since both one-sided
    limits agree, the two sided limit exists and we can say
    $\ds \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x-1}{x^2(x+2)} = -\infty$.

    The $x^2$ factor in the denominator ensures that the two-sided limit
    exists.  What if $x^2$ were replaced by $x$, $x^3$, or $x^4$?
  \item %7c
    Recall that $\ds \cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}$. Since $x\to \pi^-$
    we can assume that $x$ is close to $\pi$ so $\cos x$ is close to $-1$
    and $\sin x$ is close to $0$.  Furthermore, we can assume that $x$ is
    slightly less than $\pi$, so $\sin x$ is small and positive.  A negative
    number divided by a small positive number gives a large negative number,
    so we conclude that $\ds \lim_{x\to \pi^-} \cot x = -\infty$.
  \item %7d
    It is generally a good idea in these sorts of problems to factor
    the numerator and denominator if possible.  In this case we have
    $\ds \frac{x^2-2x}{x^2-4x+4} = \frac{x(x-2)}{(x-2)^2}$.  Since we
    are taking the limit $x\to 2^-$ we can assume that $x\ne 2$ so we can
    cancel a factor of $x-2$ from the numerator and denominator, giving
    $\ds \lim_{x\to 2^-} \frac{x^2-2x}{x^2-4x+4} = \lim_{x\to 2^-}
    \frac{x}{x-2}$.

    Now we are in a situation very similar to that of part (a).  An analysis
    similar that of part (a) tells us that the numerator 
    $x$ is close to $2$, a positive number, the denominator $x-2$ is close
    to $0$ and negative, so the quotient is a large negative number, i.e.
    $\lim_{x\to 2^-} \frac{x}{x-2} = -\infty$.
  \end{enumerate}
\item %8
  The function tends to a finite limit
  everywhere except possibly where the denominator is $0$.  So our 
  candidates for asymptotes are where $3x-2x^2=0$, i.e., $x=0$ and $x=3/2$.

  Just to the left of $x=0$ the numerator 
  is close to $1$, a positive number, and the
  denominator $x(3-2x)$ is close to $x(3)$, a small negative number,
  so we have $\ds \lim_{x\to 0^-} \frac{x^2+1}{3x-2x^2} = -\infty$.
  Just to the right of $x=0$ the numerator is still close to $1$ and the
  denominator $x(3-2x)$ is close to $x(3)$, a small positive number,
  so $\ds\lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{x^2+1}{3x-2x^2} = +\infty$.

  Just to the left of $x=3/2$, the numerator is positive and the denominator
  $x(3-2x)$ is small and positive, 
  so $\ds\lim_{x\to \frac{3}{2}^-} \frac{x^2+1}{3x-2x^2}
  = +\infty$, and just to the right of $x=3/2$, the numerator is still 
  positive and the denominator $x(3-2x)$ is small and negative, so
  $\ds\lim_{x\to \frac{3}{2}^+} \frac{x^2+1}{3x-2x^2} = -\infty$.

  In summary, the function $\ds \frac{x^2+1}{3x-2x^2}$ has asymptotes at
  $x=0$ and $x=3/2$.
